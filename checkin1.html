<h1>Understanding Cardiometabolic Health Through Research</h1>

<h2>My Work with the UMass Mind Program</h2>

<p>
Through my work with the UMass Mind Program, I help lead cardiometabolic screening initiatives focused on prevention and education. 
By collecting biometric data such as blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels, I have gained a deeper understanding of how circulation and metabolism interact. 
This experience has shown me how physiological data becomes meaningful when translated into clear, actionable health guidance for participants.

<h2>What Cardiometabolic Research Has Taught Me</h2>

<ul>
    <li>How blood pressure reflects vascular resistance</li>
    <li>Why glucose regulation influences long-term cardiovascular risk</li>
    <li>The importance of preventive health education</li>
    <li>How small biomarker changes signal broader systemic patterns</li>
</ul>

<h3>Skills I Continue to Develop</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Interpreting physiological datasets</li>
    <li>Communicating complex health information clearly</li>
    <li>Connecting metabolic data to patient outcomes</li>
    <li>Applying systems-level thinking to research</li>
</ol>
