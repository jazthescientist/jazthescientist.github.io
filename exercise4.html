    <h1>My Academic and Clinical Interests</h1>

    <p>I currently do research on viral diversity in the Blanchard Lab. My work focuses on uncovering hidden RNA viruses in soil ecosystems, pulling from the data in the scientific paper where this image comes from. This paper is part of the framework of my research. </p>

    <p> Also, I am interested in pursuing a career in cardiovascular perfusion and working in cardiac surgery environments so I can work with hearts forever! It may seem different from my current research, but I have always been interested in how we can use technology and research to further healthcare in various ways. </p>

    <p>Here I am shadowing a Perfusionist during open heart surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital! I spent 2025 gaining clinical exposure, trying to better understand perfusion and surgical teamwork.</p>
